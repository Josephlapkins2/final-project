  <h2>Welcome to the best top five list of Anime!</h2>
  <dl>
  <dt>  Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest (Crunchyroll) </dt>
  <dd>Natsu and friends return in a new adventure with Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest. Following the events of the original anime, our plucky protagonist and friends travel to the very first Wizard Guild to take on one of the oldest uncompleted quests ever. So far, the series continues to have its fun shenanigans while adding some new faces to the mix. J.C. Staff, the studio behind Food Wars! and Edens Zero, is producing the animation this time around instead of A-1 Pictures from the original run. If you’re a fan of Fairy Tail, there’s just more to love with this continuation of the series. Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest is now available on Crunchyroll.</dd>
  <dt> Suicide Squad ISEKAI (Hulu, MAX, Disney+)
</dt>
  <dd> the highly anticipated Suicide Squad ISEKAI is finally here! It’s amazing to see how DC has branched out into anime with Batman Ninja and the plethora of animated originals they have created over the years. In usual Suicide Squad fashion, fan-favorite Harley Quinn and the other eclectic members of this criminal team are put on an impossible task that leads them into a strange new world. As the title suggests, this series is an isekai with DC characters, so of course we can expect ridiculous antics. Not to mention, Wit Studio is producing the animation, and they’re well known for Attack on Titan and Spy x Family. All these elements combined just scream a good time if you’re a fan of either DC or isekai anime. Suicide Squad ISEKAI is now available on Hulu, MAX, and Disney+.</dd>
  <dt> Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture (Hulu, Disney+) </dt>
  <dd>Another series making a return this season is Code Geass. Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture follows the events of the Lelouch of the Resurrection 2019 movie, which is part of an alternate timeline that stemmed from the compilation films prior. So if you’ve only seen the original series, it may help to catch up on these films first. Studio Sunrise, which is known for Mobile Suit Gundam and Cowboy Bebop, is back again heading production on the series so expect some great mecha action. Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture is now available on Hulu and Disney+.</dd>
   <dt> Tower of God Season 2 (Crunchyroll)  </dt>
  <dd>Tower of God returns with Season 2 this summer! When we last left the protagonist Bam, his plans were changed and he was left with a huge decision to make. The Answer Studio is taking the animation production reins from Telecom Animation Film this season. With that said, the creative team did mention that Season 2 has a new art style, with the goal of being closer to the original webtoon. Knowing that some time has passed since the events of Season 1, it’ll be interesting to see how some reunions (if any) unfold as the season progresses. Tower of God Season 2 is available now on Crunchyroll.</dd>
   <dt> The Elusive Samurai (Crunchyroll) </dt>
  <dd>Are you looking for a new series with some humor and dark, intense action this season? Then the Elusive Samurai is one to check out. The series follows Tokiyuki, the next successor to the shogunate, who doesn’t care about being a leader. Instead, he wants to live a carefree life. That is until disaster happens and his home is destroyed alongside everyone he cares for. With the assistance of an odd priest, Tokiyuki continues to live on despite the threat of being hunted down. Cloverworks, the studio behind Bocchi the Rock! and Wind Breaker, is taking on animation for the series, and the visuals are amazing. From the choices of facial expressions to the beautifully animated movement of our swift protagonist, there’s a lot to look forward to with this new series. The Elusive Samurai is now available on Crunchyroll.</dd>
