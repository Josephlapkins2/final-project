  <h2>Welcome to the best top five list of Cartoons!</h2>
  <dl>
  <dt>  Futurama Season 12 (Hulu) </dt>
  <dd>Futurama is back yet again for Season 12. The beloved cult classic lives on as Hulu renewed it for even more hilarious episodes. What makes this revival so special is that it remembers its roots. The show rarely focuses on cameos or changes the formula for "modern-day." Instead, Futurama remembers why we fell in love with the series back in 1999.</dd>
  <dt> Scott Pilgrim Takes Off (Netflix) </dt>
  <dd>You read that right: there’s a Scott Pilgrim anime. Even better, the original cast from the 2010 movie reunited to voice their characters in the reboot/sequel, including Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aubrey Plaza, Kiernan Culkan, and Brie Larson.
Scott Pilgrim is about a struggling musician who falls in love with a girl named Ramona Flowers, but must defeat her seven evil exes before “winning” her over. It’s a super colorful, wacky story with a killer soundtrack, and the anime takes the story further than ever before.</dd>
  <dt> Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft (netflix) </dt>
  <dd> During the Castlevania: Nocturne premiere event in September, Netflix finally revealed a sneak peak at its upcoming Tomb Raider anime series. The new show will fill in the narrative gap between the more recent prequel games and the original games’ timelines. Hayley Atwell (Captain America, Agent Carter) will voice Lara Croft.</dd>
   <dt> My Adventures with Superman (Max)  </dt>
  <dd>We’ve seen a lot of TV shows explore stages in Clark Kent’s life as Superman. In Smallville, we followed his teenage years. In Superman & Lois, we fast-forwarded to his life as a father of two two teenage sons. We’ve even followed Clark’s canine best friend in Krypto the Superdog.
But in this new animated series from Adult Swim, we twenty-somethings Clark and Lois build their careers in journalism while falling in love. We may not have needed yet another show about Superman, but we loved tuning in anyway.</dd>
   <dt> The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy (Amazon Prime)  </dt>
  <dd>Lest you think 2024 is all about sequels and reboots, Amazon Prime is here to bring you some original animation.
Starring Keke Palmer, Stephanie Hsu, and Kieran Culkin, The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy is about alien doctors curing wild and dangerous space ailments.This is a wacky adult comedy you won’t want to miss.</dd>
